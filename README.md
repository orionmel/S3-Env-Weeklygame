**Brief**: In the visualisation and computational environment course, I was exposed to the fungus plugin in unity, and I had a great interest in narrative games, so I used this plugin to complete a narrative adventure game where users interact through dialogue text to complete the final task

**A good story can make a mediocre game more memorable and meaningful**

**The story of my game :**
On a peaceful day, a great demon appeared in the town, and because he hated the people in the town who had expelled him, he came back to take revenge, and the magic of the king of the town became disappeared, and you, as a warrior, at the call of the townspeople, came to this town and heard the townspeople say that the great demon had turned the king into an object in his castle. But the Great Demon King is hard to find, you need to find monsters in the town who know the Great Demon King, you can find the Great Demon King's castle...
